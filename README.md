# ProjectLAP

## Overview

Project LAP (Learn Audio Produciton) - An open source hub for everyone in music and audio production. Learn essentials, revisit basics, and share knowledge. Together we create the resource every creator wishes they had from day one.

## Getting Started

This passion project was created by Kamil Slaby to empower sound enthusiasts, aspiring producers, and anyone interested in music and audio production.  

Whether you are just starting out or refining your craft, the goal is to make essential concepts in recording, mixing, live sound, and music production both accessible and practical. Topics are curated and explained the way we wish they had been presented to us when we began our own journey.  

This is not a static resource. It is a constantly growing hub built by and for the audio community. Visit often, explore new topics, revisit fundamentals, and share your own knowledge or experiences so it keeps improving.  

Together we can build a resource that every creator wishes they had from day one. Letâ€™s create something valuable, lasting, and truly helpful for anyone curious about sound creation.
