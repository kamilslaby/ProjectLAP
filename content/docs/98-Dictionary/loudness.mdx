Loudness is the perceived intensity or strength of a sound as experienced by the human ear. Unlike sound pressure level (SPL), which measures the physical energy of a sound in decibels, loudness reflects how we feel the sound - it depends on both the amplitude and frequency of the signal, as well as the listener's hearing sensitivity.

In audio production, loudness is often measured using standards like LUFS (Loudness Units relative to Full Scale), which provide a consistent way to compare and normalize perceived volume between tracks or programs.
