Peak refers to the highest instantaneous level of an audio signal. It shows the maximum amplitude that the waveform reaches, usually measured in decibels (dB).

In digital audio, the peak level is important because if it exceeds 0 dBFS (decibels full scale), the signal clips and causes distortion. Engineers monitor peaks to prevent clipping and to maintain headroom during mixing and mastering.
