Phase describes the timing relationship of a waveform within its cycle, measured in degrees from 0° to 360°. A signal can have a positive or negative phase shift depending on whether it leads or lags another waveform.

A positive phase shift means the waveform occurs slightly ahead in time, while a negative phase shift means it occurs behind. These shifts affect how multiple signals combine, influencing clarity, punch, and stereo image in a mix.
