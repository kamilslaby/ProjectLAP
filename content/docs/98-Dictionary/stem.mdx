Stem is a grouped audio file that contains a mix of several related tracks combined into one. For example, a “drums stem” may include all drum tracks mixed together, or a “vocal stem” may include the lead and backing vocals.

Stems are often used for remixing, mastering, live performance, or film post-production. They allow engineers to adjust groups of sounds without accessing every individual track, offering flexibility while keeping sessions organized.
