Track is an individual recording or sound source within a session, such as a vocal take, guitar part, or synth layer. In the context of a digital audio workstation (DAW), the word track is often used in the same way as channel on an analog or digital console. Both represent a signal path that carries audio or MIDI data, complete with controls for volume, pan, inserts, sends, and automation.

A track, however, is not the same as a stem. A trackout means exporting each track individually, giving complete control over every element during mixing. A stem out exports grouped tracks, such as all drums or all vocals, for easier handling when detailed mixing is not required.
