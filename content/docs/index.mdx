# Getting Started

This passion project was created by [Kamil Slaby](https://www.kamilslaby.com/) from [Superior](https://www.superior-studios.com/) to empower sound enthusiasts, aspiring producers, and anyone seeking a strong foundation in the world of audio.

Whether you are just starting out or refining your craft, the goal is to make essential concepts in recording, mixing, live sound, and music production both accessible and practical. The topics here are curated and explained in the way we wish they had been presented to us when we began our own journey.

This is not a static resource. It is a growing hub built by and for the audio community. Visit often, explore new topics, revisit the fundamentals, and share your own knowledge or experiences to help it grow.

Together, we can create the resource we all wish we had from day one. Let us build something valuable, lasting, and truly helpful for the next generation of sound engineers.
