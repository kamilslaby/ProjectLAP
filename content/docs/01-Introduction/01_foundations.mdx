## What is sound

We need to begin with some foundations, and a good place to start is by clarifying key language concepts before building on them. 

- Sound refers to vibrations that travel through air or another medium and can be perceived by the human ear. It belongs to the physical and organic world of pressure waves that reach our hearing.
- Audio on the other hand is the representation of sound in a form that can be recorded, processed, transmitted, or reproduced. When we speak of audio we are usually working with analog or digital signals that allow us to capture and manipulate sound. 

In short, sound is the phenomenon itself, and audio is how we store, process, and recreate it.

## More about sound

Sound is all around us in daily life, from the music we enjoy to the hum of traffic outside the window. At its simplest, sound is a vibration that moves through a medium such as air, water, or even metal. Our ears pick up these vibrations and our brain interprets them as what we recognize as sound. This is why there can be no sound in the vacuum of space: without air or another material to carry vibrations, there is nothing for our ears to hear.

When we look deeper into sound as a wave, we can describe it with several key properties:

### Key properties of sound

#### Frequency 

Frequency refers to how many times the wave repeats per second and is measured in hertz. Frequency can also be outside of human hearing scope (20hz - 20khz).

Sound waves with frequencies below the lower limit of human audibility (generally 20 Hz). Humans cannot hear infrasound but may feel it as a vibration if the sound pressure is 
Earthquakes, the movement of tectonic plates, and potentially wind in large natural formations. 

#### Pitch

Pitch is how our ears perceive frequency, with higher frequencies heard as higher notes and lower frequencies as deeper tones.

#### Wavelength

Wavelength describes the physical distance between two repeating points in the wave, such as peak to peak. Phase explains the alignment of two or more waves, which determines whether they reinforce each other or cancel out when combined. 

Together these concepts give us a framework to understand how sound behaves in both natural hearing and technical audio processing.

### Factors affecting sound 

- Temperature
- Humidity


### Human hearing
- range
- sensitivity of hearing depending on the Hz


### Sound in context of studio
- Sound proofing, why?, how? types of panels,
