*This guide outlines best practices for preparing and delivering completed mixes. Follow each step carefully to ensure your work is ready for archiving, mastering, and future use.*

## Step 1. Folders

- Start by doing a backup of the session for your own convinience and safety.
- Create folders depnding what you are exporting: Masters, Stems. Maintain a clear and consistent folder structure. Separate final mixes, session files, and stems. Make sure everything is easy to locate and understand by looking at it.

## Step 2. Name the Files

Name the tracks in a consistent manner. The stems will need less details in them. The exported mixes will need more of it.

**General rules for naming:**
* Use only letters and numbers
* Do not use symbols (*?>”|/:+#)
* If submitting a clean version, add “Clean” after the version type

**Nameing rules for stems**
* Artist Name or initials
* Song Title
* Track number
* Track name
* Extra notes if needed

Example: 

```txt

  In case of uising only initials:
    KS_InitSix_Synths_LeadSynth
    KS_InitSix_Synths_Bass
    KS_InitSix_Bass_SubHits
    KS_InitSix_FX_Reverb_Hall_1

  In case of using a full name of the artist:
    KamilSlaby_InitSix_FX_Reverb_Hall_2
    KamilSlaby_InitSix_FX_Delay_1
    KamilSlaby_InitSix_Drums_KickOut
    KamilSlaby_InitSix_Drums_SnareTop_1
    KamilSlaby_InitSix_Drums_SnareTop_Trigger
```

**Nameing rules for fial mixes:**
* Artist Name
* Song Title
* Type of the mix (FullMix, Acappella, Instrumental)
* Tempo (BPM)
* Date Created (YYYYMMDD)
* Extra notes if needed

**Format:**
ArtistName_SongTitle_MixType_Tempo_DateCreated

Example: 

```txt
    KamilSlaby_InitSix_FullMix_120bpm_20250930
    KamilSlaby_DritingInSpace_FullMix_120bpm_20250825
```

## Step 3. Prepare the Stems

Stems must follow these rules:

* Same duration with identical start and end points (Good pratice is: Include one bar of silence at the beginning and end)
* Deliver stems “wet” with effects applied (faders at 0 dB)
* Provide both wet and dry vocals with FX printed separately
* Separate instruments as much as possible (e.g. acoustic guitars, electric guitars, solos)
* Separate lead vocals, background vocals, and adlibs
* Provide individual drum elements plus a stereo stem of the full kit.
* Audience microphones in live recordings should be separated if possible
* Tuning (Autotune, Melodyne) should be applied on dry vocals. Unless it ia creative effect. Then would be great to have raw vocals saved for future.

## Step 4. Mix Variants

Stndard set of mixes:
* **Main Mix**: Final version for final mastering
* **Instrumental**: No vocals
* **TV Mix**: No lead vocal, includes backing vocals and instruments
* **A Cappella**: Vocals only
* **Edited (Clean)**: Non explicit version if required

Extra: 
* **Alternate Mixes (if needed):**
* Technical revisions (e.g. vocal up, guitar down 2 dB)
* Creative revisions (significant changes to arrangement or instrumentation)
