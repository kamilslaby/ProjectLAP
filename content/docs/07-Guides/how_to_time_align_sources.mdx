When recording in a studio or on location, multiple microphones often capture the same source, such as a drum kit, guitar amp, or ensemble. Because each microphone is at a different distance from the sound, the signals can arrive slightly out of sync, creating phase issues where some frequencies cancel each other. To fix this, start by visually inspecting the waveforms in your DAW and nudging them so their transients align. Aligning the peaks and troughs ensures the signals reinforce each other rather than cancel. Listening carefully in mono can reveal subtle phase problems, particularly on drums or layered vocals. Proper timing alignment keeps the mix clear, punchy, and balanced.

Another way to manage phase during recording is to apply small delays to specific channels so that all microphones capture the sound in phase. This can be done using delay settings on the console or in the audio interface, effectively compensating for differences in distance between microphones and the source. By aligning the signals at the moment of recording, you reduce the need for corrective editing later and ensure that transients, tone, and low-end frequencies combine cleanly. This proactive approach helps achieve a more natural, cohesive sound from the start.

Phase Alignment Quick Checklist:
1. Position microphones carefully to minimize phase issues.
2. Record a test snippet with all mics.
3. Align waveforms by nudging tracks so transients match.
4. Listen in mono to detect cancellations.
5. Invert polarity if needed.
6. Apply small delays to compensate for mic distance.
7. Check bass and key elements for reinforcement.
