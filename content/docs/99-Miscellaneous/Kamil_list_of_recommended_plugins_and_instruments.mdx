Sometimes I speak with someone who asks me for a recommendation about a specific tool, category, or what I use for a certain process. So I decided to put everything together for inspiration. This is my list of recommendations for software, plugins, and virtual instruments that I use to create. Enjoy! If you know something better that could replace any of these, please let me know. I am always on the lookout for greater things.
