Sometimes I speak with someone who asks me for a recommendation about a specific tool or what I use for a certain process. So I decided to put everything together for inspiration. This is my list of recommendations for software, plugins, and virtual instruments that I use to create. Enjoy! If you know something better that could replace any of these, please let me know. I am always on the lookout for greater things.

## Software + DAWs
- [Cockos Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) - My main DAW. I use if for everything.
- [Steinberg Nuendo 14](https://www.steinberg.net/nuendo/) - I use it for movies, It has integrated Dolby Rendered. Works great for such big projects.
- [Steinberg SpectraLayers](https://www.steinberg.net/spectralayers/) - for audio restoration and spectral editing.

## Plugins 

### Channel Strip
- [PSP InfiniStrip](https://www.pspaudioware.com/products/psp-infinistrip) - I think this is the best channel strip. Everything about it is amazing. I maily use it for 4 compressors it offers: (VCA, OPTO, FET, OldSchool)

### EQ
