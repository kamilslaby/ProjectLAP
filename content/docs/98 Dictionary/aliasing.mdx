Audio aliasing is a distortion effect that occurs when an analog audio signal is converted to a digital signal with an insufficient sampling rate. This results in the high-frequency components of the signal being misinterpreted, causing unwanted frequencies, or "aliases," to appear in the digital recording. These alias frequencies were not present in the original analog signal and can sound like distorted tones or artifacts in the audio.
